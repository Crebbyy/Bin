This is a list of the Oblivion Bingo objectives. In order to add objectives, use the following format: {"name": "Objective"},. In order for it to work it must be added between the brackets, if you add it outside of the brackets it will not work.

If you have any questions on how to add objectives just ask me, if you don't want to make a github account I can just add the objectives for you.
